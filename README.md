# Hotel_Cancellations-Decision_Trees
Analysis of hotel guest data to build a decision tree model to predict in advance which bookings may end up being cancelled. 

### Project Description:

This dataset contains attributes of hotel customers' booking details. The data will be analyzed to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations by building a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance. 

### Skills:

Logistic regression, Multicollinearity, Finding optimal threshold using AUC-ROC curve, Decision trees, Pruning, Data Pre-processing, Exploratory Data Analysis (Variable Identification, Univariate analysis, Bi-Variate analysis), Python
