# Hotel_Cancellations-Decision_Trees
Analysis of hotel guest data to build a decision tree model to predict in advance which bookings may end up being cancelled. 

### Project Description:

This dataset contains attributes of hotel customers' booking details. The data will be analyzed to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations by building a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance. 

### Skills:

Logistic regression, Multicollinearity, Finding optimal threshold using AUC-ROC curve, Decision trees, Pruning, Data Pre-processing, Exploratory Data Analysis (Variable Identification, Univariate analysis, Bi-Variate analysis), Python

## This project contains 1 files:

Full notebook (Hotel_cancellations_project_FULL_NOTEBOOK.ipynb)

> This notebook contains the entirety of the project including all of the code to perform a run-down of the data/datatypes, exploratory data analysis, and all insights and observations. This file contains all variations/tests of the decision tree model with various pruning methods. The final (best) model (image below) is at the bottom of the notebook with the conclusions and actionable insights. 

### Libraries used:

statsmodels, sklearn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
